Common Commands that might be needed (so I dont loose them):

Move files from /etc/nixos into ~/nix-config witch is were the git repo is
cp /etc/nixos* ~/nix-config

Moving the files back (should work for now until I add folders)
cp ~/nix-config/*.nix /etc/nixos

build system
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos/#dan
Note: sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ~/nix-config/#dan 
should also work but I feel like keeping it in etc
